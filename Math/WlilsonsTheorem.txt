Theorem: Wilson's theorem states that a natural number n > 1 is a prime number if and only if the product of all the positive integers less than n is one less than a multiple of n. That is the factorial

(n-1)! == 1 * 2 * 3 ....*(n-1) satisfies

(n-1)! == -1 (mod n)

exactly when n is a prime number. In other words, any integer n > 1 is a prime number if, and only if, (n − 1)! + 1 is divisible by n
